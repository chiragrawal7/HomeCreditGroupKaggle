# Extensive EDA Script - In this script, I would just try to perform extensive EDA of 
#                         data sets



#plotting the variables
plot_str(application_train) #112 variables

# looking for missing values
plot_missing(application_train)

#plotting histogram
plot_histogram(application_train)
